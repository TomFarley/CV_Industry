%
%I should like to apply for the role of \textit{Scrape-Off Layer Turbulence Physicist}, for which I feel I am particularly well suited.
%% and I hope to demonstrate why.
%I see MAST-U, with its unique visible imaging capabilities, cutting edge fast framing cameras, versatile divertor science facility and powerful mid-plane reciprocating probe system, as an extremely exciting opportunity for significantly advancing our understanding of scrape-off layer (SOL) physics.
%In particular, it will be fascinating to investigate the effects of the super-X divertor and varied divertor and detachment regimes on both upstream and divertor SOL dynamics.
%
%My PhD project as part of the Fusion CDT, entitled `\textit{Analysis of Scrape-Off Layer Plasma Filaments Through Fast Visible Imaging}', has given me a strong background in SOL physics, particularly filamentary transport of particles.
%I already have considerable experience in the analysis of fast visible camera data on MAST and I see this position as the perfect opportunity to develop this expertise further, particularly in taking advantage of the stereoscopic imaging measurements that will be possible on MAST-U.
%My existing familiarity with the MAST-U tokamak and its visual camera and Langmuir probe systems will enable me to quickly start applying MAST-U's diagnostics to their full potential.
%
%My work performing novel SOL power decay length measurements, using IR thermography on JET, further demonstrates my experience with SOL physics, imaging measurements and working within different research groups.
%My work on neutral beam negative ion sources has provided me with valuable experience working hands on with vacuum systems and performing Langmuir probe measurements in weakly magnetised RF plasmas.
%I am highly proficient in python and have developed the large, sophisticated Elzar suite of tools for enhancing, analysing and reviewing fast camera data.
%
%I am very well organised and believe I will operate the diagnostic systems with efficiency, applying good practice and maintaining accurate records of measurements, adaptations and changes.
%I appreciate my experience with electrical probes is not at the same level as that which I have with imaging techniques, but I believe I can rapidly develop these skills.
%My strong record of publications at this early stage in my career, with contributions towards 8 publications and a first author paper in preparation, demonstrate my proven ability to conduct high quality scientific research.
%
%While my anticipated thesis submission date is not until early 2019, I hope my strengths and experience in the area will justify a later start date for the position.
%I attach my CV with further evidence of my suitability for this position and I would be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities further at interview. 
%%I look forward to hearing from you.
