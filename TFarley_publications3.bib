abstract = {New results from MAST are presented that focus on validating models in order to extrapolate to future devices. Measurements during start-up experiments have shown how the bulk ion temperature rise scales with the square of the reconnecting field. During the current ramp up models are not able to correctly predict the current diffusion. Experiments have been performed looking at edge and core turbulence. At the edge detailed studies have revealed how filament characteristic are responsible for determining the near and far SOL density profiles. In the core the intrinsic rotation and electron scale turbulence have been measured. The role that the fast ion gradient has on redistributing fast ions through fishbone modes has led to a redesign of the neutral beam injector on MAST Upgrade. In H-mode the turbulence at the pedestal top has been shown to be consistent with being due to electron temperature gradient modes. A reconnection process appears to occur during ELMs and the number of filaments released determines the power profile at the divertor. Resonant magnetic perturbations can mitigate ELMs provided the edge peeling response is maximised and the core kink response minimised. The mitigation of intrinsic error fields with toroidal mode number n{\textgreater}1 has been shown to be important for plasma performance.},

abstract = {Measurements have been made of the extracted H- current and co-extracted electron current from the SNIF negative ion source. The dependence of these currents on RF power, plasma insert bias voltage and source filling pressure have been measured. In all cases the ratio of co-extracted electron current to negative ion current is less than unity. During parameter scans data was collected using a high resolution spectrometer viewing the extraction region of the non-caesiated source in order to attempt to understand the low ratio of co-extracted electrons to negative ions. Data was collected for the atomic Balmer series and in the molecular Fulcher range. Collisional radiative modelling has been applied to this data to improve understanding of the conditions in the extraction region from calculated gas and electron temperatures. The results are presented here. Plans for further diagnostic improvements on SNIF are also discussed.},

abstract = {Using footage from high speed movies taken of the boundary plasma in the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) general properties of filaments are inferred through statistical moments. Filaments are observed up to and beyond the $\psi$N= 1.5 flux surface which, in single null configurations, lies well beyond the secondary separatrix and leads to filaments observed {\textgreater} 30 cm from the top of the plasma. In the divertor filaments are observed to connect through to the target, however a quiescent region is observed close to the X-point where no coherent filaments are identified. This region coincides with a sharp rise in the integrated magnetic shear which may change the nature of the filament cross-section.},

abstract = {This paper deals with a study of H − /D − negative ion surface production on diamond in low pressure H 2 /D 2 plasmas. A sample placed in the plasma is negatively biased with respect to plasma potential. Upon positive ion impacts on the sample, some negative ions are formed and detected according to their mass and energy by a mass spectrometer placed in front of the sample. The experimental methods developed to study negative ion surface production and obtain negative ion energy and angle distribution functions are first presented. Different diamond materials ranging from nanocrystalline to single crystal layers, either doped with boron or intrinsic, are then investigated and compared with graphite. The negative ion yields obtained are presented as a function of different experimental parameters such as the exposure time, the sample bias which determines the positive ion impact energy and the sample surface temperature. It is concluded from these experiments that the electronic properties of diamond materials, among them the negative electron affinity, seem to be favourable for negative-ion surface production. However, the negative ion yield decreases with the plasma induced defect density.},

abstract = {Four numerical codes are employed to investigate the dynamics of scrape-off layer flaments in tokamak relevant conditions. Experimental measurements were taken in the MAST device using visual camera imaging, which allows the evaluation of the perpendicular size and velocity of the flaments, as well as the combination of density and temperature associated with the perturbation. A new algorithm based on the light emission integrated along the feld lines associated with the position of the flament is developed to ensure that it is properly detected and tracked. The flaments are found to have velocities of the order of − 1 km s 1 , a perpendicular diameter of around 2–3 cm and a density amplitude 2–3.5 times the background plasma. 3D and 2D numerical codes (the STORM module of BOUT++, GBS, HESEL and TOKAM3X) are used to reproduce the motion of the observed flaments with the purpose of validating the codes and of better understanding the experimental data. Good agreement is found between the 3D codes. The seeded flament simulations are also able to reproduce the dynamics observed in experiments with accuracy up to the experimental errorbar levels. In addition, the numerical results showed that flaments characterised by similar size and light emission intensity can have quite different dynamics if the pressure perturbation is distributed differently between density and temperature components. As an additional beneft, several observations on the dynamics of the flaments in the presence of evolving temperature felds were made and led to a better understanding of the behaviour of these coherent structures.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the design methodologies applied to JET's ITER-like Wall, many of which have been adopted by ITER, and the experimental evaluation of their effectiveness. Avoiding exposed edges over 40mm effective height and using rigorous methods to ensure true implementation good power handling, within the expected design values has been achieved. Compromises had to be made in the design of the upper dump plate, which has led to minor melting during vertical disruptions. This experience has direct relevance to the ITER plasma facing components (PFCs) where stringent criteria for exposure of edges at the castellation scale have not yet been set and penetration of field lines into areas in extreme off-normal configurations has to be considered. In addition, to prevent potential risks of melting due to tile misalignment, damage or design errors, an active protection system was put in place. The design requirements for the Be tiles includes good power handling for start-up limiter operation and the shielding of large of metallic components such as antennas and diagnostics from the high power fluxes due to high power input diverted ELMy H modes. In the design of the tiles surface, it is assumed an exponential decay of power density with radius, the scrape-off length values of 10mm for ohmic and L-mode plasmas and 5mm for H-mode plasmas; the scrape-off layer (SOL) surface is approximated by 2pR (where R is the SOL major radius). The limits on the surface temperature of the new Be tiles will constrain limiter operation and set the minimum gaps for diverted operation and require active protection to guard against melting. To test these limits and validate the assumptions of the design, experiments were performed with varying additional power and distance to the limiters in both L-mode and H-mode. Both shadowing and power handling depend on the field line angle as well as the plasma scrape-off length. Thus the power handling limitations will depend upon plasma scenario and is being explored experimentally. The impact on the overall performance caused by misalignments, damage and other possible non-conformances appears minimal. Real time active protection relying on near IR cameras has been used successfully for the protection of the main chamber and is close to being fully commissioned.},
