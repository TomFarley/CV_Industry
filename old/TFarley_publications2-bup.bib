@article{Cartry2017,
abstract = {This paper deals with a study of H − /D − negative ion surface production on diamond in low pressure H 2 /D 2 plasmas. A sample placed in the plasma is negatively biased with respect to plasma potential. Upon positive ion impacts on the sample, some negative ions are formed and detected according to their mass and energy by a mass spectrometer placed in front of the sample. The experimental methods developed to study negative ion surface production and obtain negative ion energy and angle distribution functions are first presented. Different diamond materials ranging from nanocrystalline to single crystal layers, either doped with boron or intrinsic, are then investigated and compared with graphite. The negative ion yields obtained are presented as a function of different experimental parameters such as the exposure time, the sample bias which determines the positive ion impact energy and the sample surface temperature. It is concluded from these experiments that the electronic properties of diamond materials, among them the negative electron affinity, seem to be favourable for negative-ion surface production. However, the negative ion yield decreases with the plasma induced defect density.},

@article{Arnoux2013b,
abstract = {Recent experiments at JET combining reciprocating probe measurements upstream and infrared thermography at the plasma-facing components (PFC) on plasmas in limiter configurations show that the common approach to predicting the power load on the limiter underestimates the heat flux at the contact point by a factor 1.5-3. The current model and scaling laws used for predicting the power load onto the first wall during limiter current ramp-up/down in ITER are uncertain and a better understanding of the heat transport to the PFCs is required. The heat loads on PFCs are usually predicted by projecting the parallel heat flux associated with scrape-off layer (SOL) properties at the outer mid-plane (upstream) along the magnetic field lines to the limiter surface and deducing the surface heat flux through a cosine law, thus ignoring any local effect of the PFC on transport within the SOL. The underestimate of the heat flux is systematic in inner wall limiter configurations, independent of the plasma parameters, whereas in outer limiter configuration this is not observed, probably because of the much shorter SOL power decay length. Models that can explain this enhanced heat flux around the contact point are proposed and discussed although no definitive conclusion can be drawn. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the design methodologies applied to JET's ITER-like Wall, many of which have been adopted by ITER, and the experimental evaluation of their effectiveness. Avoiding exposed edges over 40mm effective height and using rigorous methods to ensure true implementation good power handling, within the expected design values has been achieved. Compromises had to be made in the design of the upper dump plate, which has led to minor melting during vertical disruptions. This experience has direct relevance to the ITER plasma facing components (PFCs) where stringent criteria for exposure of edges at the castellation scale have not yet been set and penetration of field lines into areas in extreme off-normal configurations has to be considered. In addition, to prevent potential risks of melting due to tile misalignment, damage or design errors, an active protection system was put in place. The design requirements for the Be tiles includes good power handling for start-up limiter operation and the shielding of large of metallic components such as antennas and diagnostics from the high power fluxes due to high power input diverted ELMy H modes. In the design of the tiles surface, it is assumed an exponential decay of power density with radius, the scrape-off length values of 10mm for ohmic and L-mode plasmas and 5mm for H-mode plasmas; the scrape-off layer (SOL) surface is approximated by 2pR (where R is the SOL major radius). The limits on the surface temperature of the new Be tiles will constrain limiter operation and set the minimum gaps for diverted operation and require active protection to guard against melting. To test these limits and validate the assumptions of the design, experiments were performed with varying additional power and distance to the limiters in both L-mode and H-mode. Both shadowing and power handling depend on the field line angle as well as the plasma scrape-off length. Thus the power handling limitations will depend upon plasma scenario and is being explored experimentally. The impact on the overall performance caused by misalignments, damage and other possible non-conformances appears minimal. Real time active protection relying on near IR cameras has been used successfully for the protection of the main chamber and is close to being fully commissioned.},
